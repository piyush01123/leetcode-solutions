# Problem Statement:
<p>An <strong>n-bit gray code sequence</strong> is a sequence of <code>2<sup>n</sup></code> integers where:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Every integer is in the <strong>inclusive</strong> range <code>[0, 2<sup>n</sup> - 1]</code>,</li>
	<li>The first integer is <code>0</code>,</li>
	<li>An integer appears <strong>no more than once</strong> in the sequence,</li>
	<li>The binary representation of every pair of <strong>adjacent</strong> integers differs by <strong>exactly one bit</strong>, and</li>
	<li>The binary representation of the <strong>first</strong> and <strong>last</strong> integers differs by <strong>exactly one bit</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given an integer <code>n</code>, return <em>any valid <strong>n-bit gray code sequence</strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1,3,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 0<u>0</u> and 0<u>1</u> differ by one bit
- <u>0</u>1 and <u>1</u>1 differ by one bit
- 1<u>1</u> and 1<u>0</u> differ by one bit
- <u>1</u>0 and <u>0</u>0 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- <u>0</u>0 and <u>1</u>0 differ by one bit
- 1<u>0</u> and 1<u>1</u> differ by one bit
- <u>1</u>1 and <u>0</u>1 differ by one bit
- 0<u>1</u> and 0<u>0</u> differ by one bit
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1]
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 16</code></li>
</ul>

# Solution:
We see the pattern:
```
1: [0,1]
2: [00,01,11,10]
3: [000,001,011,010,110,111,101,100]
```
Notice the following recursive relation:
```
grayCode(n) = [grayCode(n-1), new_part]
```
`new_part` consists of `1` added to the left of each item in reversed sequence of `grayCode(n-1)`.

This leads us to the following code:
```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        if n==1: return [0,1]
        prev = self.grayCode(n-1)
        return prev + [2**(n-1)+i for i in prev[::-1]]
```
Time complexity: `O(n)`.
